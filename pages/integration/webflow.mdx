You are just 2 steps away from adding mySHOEFITTER to your shop and reduce your return rate drastically.

### Add the Script

1. **Log into Webflow:** Open your browser, navigate to the Webflow website (https://webflow.com), and log into your account.

2. **Choose your project:** From your dashboard, click on the E-Commerce project you wish to add the custom script tag to.

3. **Navigate to Project Settings:** Once inside your project, click on the "Project Settings" button located at the top right corner of the dashboard.

4. **Select the Custom Code section:** Inside Project Settings, navigate to the "Custom Code" tab found on the top menu.

5. **Add the script in the Footer Code section:** Under the "Footer Code" box, you can add the following script tag. The code you insert here will be added before the `</body>` tag on every page across your site. Make sure your script tag begins with `<script>` and ends with `</script>`.

```html filename="index.html" copy
<!-- Load the mySHOEFITTER Script -->
<script src="https://js.myshoefitter.com/v1/script.js"></script>

<!-- Initialize mySHOEFITTER -->
<script type="application/javascript">
  myshoefitter.init({
    shopId: 'your-shop-id', // <- Replace
    productId: 'custom-product-id' // <- Replace
  });
</script>
```

6. **Save your changes:** Click the "Save Changes" button on the top right corner of the page.

7. **Publish your site:** Navigate back to the designer by clicking on the designer icon on the left-hand side. Click on the "Publish" button at the top right corner of the designer to make your changes live.

### Add the button

1. **Go to Designer:** In the project's dashboard, click the "Designer" button in the top-right corner to open the Designer tool.

2. **Find your 'Add to Cart' button:** Navigate to the page that contains the "Add to Cart" button. Usually, it's in your product template page. If it's not visible in the page's structure, make sure you've added a product to the cart for testing purposes.

3. **Add a new button:** In the left panel, select "Add Elements". Then, under the "Form" section, drag a "Button" element and drop it next to the "Add to Cart" button in your design layout.

4. **Set an ID for your button:** Select your newly added button, then, on the right-side panel under "Element Settings" (the cogwheel icon), type `myshoefitter-button` into the "ID" field.

5. **Save your changes:** Click the "Save" button in the top-right corner of the Designer interface.

6. **Publish your site:** Once saved, click the "Publish" button at the top right of the designer to make your changes live.
