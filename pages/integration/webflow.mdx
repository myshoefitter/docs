### Add the Script

1. **Log into Webflow:** Open your browser, navigate to the Webflow website (https://webflow.com), and log into your account.

2. **Choose your project:** From your dashboard, click on the E-Commerce project you wish to add the custom script tag to.

3. **Navigate to Project Settings:** Once inside your project, click on the "Project Settings" button located at the top right corner of the dashboard.

4. **Select the Custom Code section:** Inside Project Settings, navigate to the "Custom Code" tab found on the top menu.

5. **Add the script in the Footer Code section:** Under the "Footer Code" box, you can add the following script tag. The code you insert here will be added before the `</body>` tag on every page across your site. Make sure your script tag begins with `<script>` and ends with `</script>`.

```html filename="index.html" {3} copy
<script src="https://cdn.myshoefitter.com/script.js" data-platform="webflow" defer></script>
```

6. **Save your changes:** Click the "Save Changes" button on the top right corner of the page.

### Add the button

1. **Go to Designer:** In the project's dashboard, click the "Designer" button in the top-right corner to open the Designer tool.

3. **Add a new button:** In the left panel, select "Add Elements". Then, under the "Form" section, drag a "Button" element and drop it next to the "Add to Cart" button in your design layout.
