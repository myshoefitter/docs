You are just 2 steps away from adding mySHOEFITTER to your shop and reduce your return rate drastically.

### Install the Plugin

1. Login to your WordPress admin dashboard.

2. On the left-hand side of the dashboard, you'll find a menu. Hover over 'Plugins', then click on 'Add New'.

3. At the top of the page, you'll find a search bar. Type in "myshoefitter".

4. Once you've found the plugin, click on the 'Install Now' button next to the plugin. WordPress will now download and install the plugin for you. Note that this does not yet activate the plugin.

5. After the plugin has been installed, the 'Install Now' button will change to say 'Activate'. Click on this 'Activate' button. This will activate the plugin, and you'll be able to start using it on your website.

6. Go to Settings -> mySHOEFITTER to adjust the plugin settings to fit your needs.
