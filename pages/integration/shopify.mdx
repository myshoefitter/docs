# Shopify
 
You are just 2 steps away from adding mySHOEFITTER to your shop and reduce your return rate drastically.

### Add the Script

1. Log in to your Shopify admin panel.

2. From the sidebar, navigate to `Online Store > Themes`.

3. Find the theme you want to edit, click `Actions`, and then click `Edit code`.

4. In the `Layout` folder, click on `theme.liquid` file or the file which renders your product page and open it.

5. Scroll down until you find the closing `</body>` tag.

6. Just before the `</body>` tag, include the script tag for your external JavaScript file, like this:

```html filename="index.html" copy
<!-- Load the mySHOEFITTER Script -->
<script src="https://js.myshoefitter.com/v1/script.js"></script>

<!-- Initialize mySHOEFITTER -->
<script type="application/javascript">
  myshoefitter.init({
    shopId: 'your-shop-id', // <- Replace
    productId: 'custom-product-id' // <- Replace
  });
</script>
```

7. Save your changes


### Add the button

1. In the code editor, go to the Sections directory and open the product-template.liquid file.

2. Find the following code block, which typically represents the "Add to Cart" button:

```html filename="index.html" {3} copy
<button type="submit" name="add" id="AddToCart">
```

3. Directly under that line of code, add your button with a custom ID, like this:

```html filename="index.html" {3} copy
<button id="myshoefitter-button">Find the right size</button>
```

4. Style your button to fit your shop scheme.

5. Click Save.
