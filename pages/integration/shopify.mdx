# Shopify
 
You are just 1 step away from adding mySHOEFITTER to your shop and reduce your return rate drastically.

### Add the Script

<video width="100%" height="auto" controls style={{marginTop: '10px', borderRadius: '10px'}}>
  <source src="/videos/shopify-integration-en.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

1. Log in to your Shopify admin panel.

2. From the sidebar, navigate to `Online Store > Themes`.

3. Find the theme you want to edit, click `Actions`, and then click `Edit code`.

4. In the `Layout` folder, click on `theme.liquid` file or the file which renders your product page and open it.

5. Scroll down until you find the closing `</body>` tag.

6. Just before the `</body>` tag, include the script tag for your external JavaScript file, like this:

```html filename="index.html" copy
<!-- Load the mySHOEFITTER Script -->
<script src="https://js.myshoefitter.com/v1/script.js"></script>

<!-- Initialize mySHOEFITTER -->
<script type="application/javascript">
  myshoefitter.init({
    shopSystem: 'shopify'
  });
</script>
```

7. Save your changes

**You are ready! The mySHOEFITTER Button should be displayed underneath your "Add to Cart"-Button!**
