You are just 2 steps away from adding mySHOEFITTER to your shop and reduce your return rate drastically.

### Add the Script

1. Log in to your Shopify admin panel.

2. From the sidebar, navigate to `Online Store > Themes`.

3. Find the theme you want to edit, click `Actions`, and then click `Edit code`.

4. In the `Layout` folder, click on `theme.liquid` file to open it.

5. Scroll down until you find the closing `</body>` tag.

6. Just before the `</body>` tag, include the script tag for your external JavaScript file, like this:

```html filename="index.html" {3} copy
<script src="https://cdn.myshoefitter.com/script.js" data-platform="shopify" defer></script>
```

7. Save your changes


### Add the button

1. In the code editor, go to the Sections directory and open the product-template.liquid file.

2. Find the following code block, which typically represents the "Add to Cart" button:

```html filename="index.html" {3} copy
<button type="submit" name="add" id="AddToCart">
```

3. Directly under that line of code, add your button with a custom ID, like this:

```html filename="index.html" {3} copy
<button id="mySF_Widget_Button">Schuhgröße herausfinden</button>
```

4. Click Save.
