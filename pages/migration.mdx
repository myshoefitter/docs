# Migration
 
The mySHOEFITTER Shop Integration was split into two parts: A light wight JavaScript Library and nice customizable Banner that will loaded through the JavaScript Library in an iFrame. This results in a faster, safer integration for our customers!

## Improvements
- Reduced the File Size from 285 KB to **3 KB**
- Reduced from 9078 to **174 Lines of Code** 
- Moved whole Banner to a hosted iFrame
- More possibilities to customize the Banner
- Encapsulated Code that won't conflict with your website anymore
- Better analytics and trackable user behaviour
- Full refactoring in typescript for better scalability, maintainability, and type safety in the codebase

## Migration Process

The migration process should'nt take longer than two minutes.

### Replace the Script

Replace the following script before your `</body>` tag

```diff filename="index.html" copy
-<script src="https://cdn.myshoefitter.com/script.js" defer></script>
```
with the new initialization method:

```html filename="index.html" copy
<!-- Load the mySHOEFITTER Script -->
<script src="https://js.myshoefitter.com/v1/script.js"></script>

<!-- Initialize mySHOEFITTER -->
<script type="application/javascript">
  myshoefitter.init({
    shopId: 'your-shop-id', // <- Replace
    productId: 'custom-product-id' // <- Replace
  });
</script>
```

### Change the Button ID

Change the ID of the Button from `mySF_Widget_Button` to `myshoefitter-button`:

```html filename="index.html" copy
<button id="myshoefitter-button">Find the right size</button>
```

### Remove the Product ID Element

```diff filename="index.html" copy
-<div id="product-id" style="display: none;">ABCXYZ123</div>
